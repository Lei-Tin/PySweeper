# PySweeper - v1.1
My personal attempt of creating a mine sweeper clone in PyGame

A light minesweeper clone written in pure Python, roughly 500 lines. 

# Features
- Fully customizable grid size and number of bombs
- Customizable display on the colors of the game
- Randomly generated bomb locations and grid
- Exceptions raised when invalid settings were given
- Ending screen

# File Directory Structure
- PySweeper.py, the main file that is reponsible for the whole game
- settings.py, file that contains numerous settings to be changed for a different experience
- Demo.png, a picture of an example game
- README.md, the file you are reading at the moment
